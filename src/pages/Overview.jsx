        I am a frontend-focused developer currently working at a beginner to
        intermediate level, with a strong interest in building clean,
        user-friendly, and scalable web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into
        functional products using modern JavaScript and component-based
        architectures.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        My primary experience lies in React and Tailwind CSS, where I focus on
        writing reusable components, managing application state, and maintaining
        a consistent UI across the application. I prefer structured codebases
        and dashboard-style layouts that resemble real-world internal tools.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Alongside frontend development, I am gradually expanding my knowledge
        toward backend concepts, API integration, and deployment workflows. I
        follow a step-by-step learning approach, building projects that help me
        strengthen both technical understanding and practical implementation.

        This dashboard portfolio represents my current learning stage, project
        progress, and development consistency. It is designed to evolve over
        time as my skills grow and my experience deepens.
